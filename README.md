# HaveSomeFUN

This repository contains fun and educational Python scripts that demonstrate graphical design and security concepts.

## Files

### Hari.py

The **Hari.py** script uses the Python `turtle` module to draw a **peacock tail** with colorful feathers and decorative circles. It simulates a festive design for **Janmashtami**, with a visual display that includes vibrant colors and a celebratory message.

- Uses `turtle` graphics for drawing feathers and circles.
- Displays a festive message at the end.
- Ideal for learning graphical programming with Python.

### Stealpass.py

The **Stealpass.py** script demonstrates a **brute-force password cracking** technique. It attempts to guess a user-defined password by systematically trying all combinations of characters until it finds a match. This script is for educational purposes, demonstrating the vulnerabilities of simple passwords and the importance of strong password protection.

- Simulates brute-force attack on a password.
- Helps understand password vulnerabilities.
- Intended for ethical and legal testing in controlled environments.

## Installation

To use these scripts, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BotSonu/HaveSomeFUN.git
```

Ensure Python is installed on your system.

## Usage

1. **Hari.py**: Run the script to generate a graphical peacock tail and display a message:
   ```bash

# HaveSomeFUN

The **HaveSomeFUN** repository is a collection of Python scripts that explore graphical design and security concepts in an engaging way. The repository includes interactive visualizations and security demonstrations, offering users an opportunity to learn about programming, automation, and ethical hacking. It is designed for both educational purposes and fun, providing insights into Python's capabilities for drawing and testing security systems.

## Files

### Hari.py

The **Hari.py** script uses the Python `turtle` module to draw a **peacock tail** with colorful feathers and decorative circles. It simulates a festive design for **Janmashtami**, with a visual display that includes vibrant colors and a celebratory message.

- Uses `turtle` graphics for drawing feathers and circles.
- Displays a festive message at the end.
- Ideal for learning graphical programming with Python.

### Stealpass.py

The **Stealpass.py** script demonstrates a **brute-force password cracking** technique. It attempts to guess a user-defined password by systematically trying all combinations of characters until it finds a match. This script is for educational purposes, demonstrating the vulnerabilities of simple passwords and the importance of strong password protection.

- Simulates brute-force attack on a password.
- Helps understand password vulnerabilities.
- Intended for ethical and legal testing in controlled environments.

## Installation
